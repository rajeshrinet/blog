## [ASEP](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/asep/)

Asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) are stochastic lattice
models of particles entering, hopping and leaving the lattice, with hard
core interaction between them. 


## [Central limit theorem](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/central-limit-theorem/)

Central limit theorem states that sum of independent and identically
distributed random numbers approach a Gaussian distribution. 
 

## [Gaussian Processes](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2018/gaussian-processes)

Gaussian processes provide a principled and tractable approach to
solving supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems. 
 

## [Ising model](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/ising-model/)

Ising model undergoes a second order phase transition as the temperature is varied.  [Read more](http://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/ising-model/)
